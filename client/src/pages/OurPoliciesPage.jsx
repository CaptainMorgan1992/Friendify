            People who travel to a new city can hire a local to show them around town.  It`s always good to know someone from the area who can give you first hand information about where to go and what to avoid.
            A common request is that a Member may have an invitation for a work party, wedding or other social event and don't want to attend it by themselves.
            Someone might want to see a movie or go out for a fika but don`t have anyone to go with.  They could "Rent a Friend" to go along with them.
            Many Friends on Friendify have unique talents and skills.  They can teach you a new language, tutor you, share a new hobby, art, dance, and much more. It`s also a great way to meet people of different cultures and religions.
